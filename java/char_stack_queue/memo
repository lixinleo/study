char stack and queque

char in java is one of primitive types. It is a 16-bit unsigned quatity.

Inside JVM, it is just a 16-bit binary number, so all arithmetic operators are available to char.

char d ='d';
System.out.println(d+13); //ASCII Code for d is 100. Therefore will display 113.

literal: a single character inside a single quote. (double quote is for String!)

get char from String:  char c = s.charAt(i);

convert char to String:
char c = 'd';
String c=String.valueOf(c);

When create queue or stack, use character

Queue<Character> q = new LinkedList();

Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
