this in javascript

It has different values depending on where it is used:

In a method, this refers to the owner object.
Alone, this refers to the global object.
In a function, this refers to the global object.
In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.


However, 

With arrow functions the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function!

Therefore, in event handler, we can access class property if we use arrow function. Otherwise, this
refer to element which fire the event and we can not access property of class.
