2. update from immutability-helper

In redux, we need to immutable update a state. Keep the old state unchangable, and create a new state with updated info.
Some time it is difficult. immutability-helper is a utility libray to make immytable update easy.

immutability-helper is a drop-in replacement for react-addons-update. It implemented a function named update
url: https://github.com/kolodny/immutability-helper/blob/master/README.md

Here is a example to use this library:

import update from 'immutability-helper';

const state = ['x'];
const newState = update(state, {$push: ['y']});
console.log(newState) // ['x', 'y']
console.log(state) // ['x']


The above we use update's $push command to add a new element to a copied state. The original state is unchanged.

Available Commands
{$push: array} push() all the items in array on the target.
{$unshift: array} unshift() all the items in array on the target.
{$splice: array of arrays} for each item in arrays call splice() on the target with the parameters provided by the item. Note: The items in the array are applied sequentially, so the order matters. The indices of the target may change during the operation.
{$set: any} replace the target entirely.
{$toggle: array of strings} toggles a list of boolean fields from the target object.
{$unset: array of strings} remove the list of keys in array from the target object.
{$merge: object} merge the keys of object with the target.
{$apply: function} passes in the current value to the function and updates it with the new returned value.
{$add: array of objects} add a value to a Map or Set. When adding to a Set you pass in an array of objects to add, when adding to a Map, you pass in [key, value] arrays like so: update(myMap, {$add: [['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 'boo']]})
{$remove: array of strings} remove the list of keys in array from a Map or Set.
